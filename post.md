# Lab 2: 

# Overview and Motivation
Welcome to the Lab 02 of CS281: Introduction to Computer Systems! 
This lab will help you get more familiar with mux and logic circuits. The lab will take you through the intricacies of the 74150 mux chip and different gates (And, Or, Not). By the end of this lab, you'll be adept at working with essential circuit components.
